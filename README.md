# YT API Search

This project was built using Lit.

## Boilerplate Usage

All code was generated by me and the only examples used for my setup were to troubleshoot running the development web server/environment.

## App Structure

All components are located within the `src/components` directory. There are two main component directories: `SplashPage` and `SearchResults`. These are loaded conditionally based on where the user is at with their search.

## Setup and Installation

To run this code locally, you will need to run the following commands:

```
nvm use

npm install

npm run start
```

Happy coding!
