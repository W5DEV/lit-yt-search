# YT API Search

This project was built using Lit.

## Boilerplate Usage

All code was generated by me and the only examples used for my setup were to troubleshoot running the development web server/environment.

## App Structure

All components are located within the `src/components` directory. There are two main component directories: `SplashPage` and `SearchResults`. These are loaded conditionally based on where the user is at with their search.

## Setup and Installation

To run this code locally, you will need an API Key for the YouTube Data API V3, which can be obtained by following the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

Once you obtain an API Key, copy the contents of the `example.env` to a new `.env` file and paste your API key in place of the placeholder.

Once you do this, you should be able to install dependencies and run the code:

```
npm install

npm run start
```

Happy coding!
